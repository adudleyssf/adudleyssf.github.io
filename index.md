## Projects

### ride_sharing App

I made this app as an app to help organize rides to and from events.  Users of the app could login and either join a new "team" or make their own "team".
Users could then post an event and anyone on their team could see when and where that event is. members of that team could then say post if they were giving rides 
with how many seats they had available in their car and users who needed a ride could click a button on the made ride registering them with that ride and 
taking one of the available seats.  I made this in mind of sports to make it an easier way to car pool back and forth from games or practices.  It also gives the users
the options to join other teams that way if you are on multiple sport or work with multiple companies you can switch between what events you are seeing with ease.

### ride-share! App
This app is being made with a team of five other people it is an app for sharing rides with other users of the app.  This app is for if you are going on a road trip and need someone to help pay for the trip you
can offer to take that person and they can offer you an amount of money for gas.  It's different from uber and lyft because this app doesn't hire drivers it just lets driver and riders hop in a car and go.
